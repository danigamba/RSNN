# RSNN
Ridiculously Simple Neural Network

## Welcome
This is an incredible simple neural network that I've implemented.
It's written in python and it has this awsome features:
- A single neuron
- One input one output regression
- No gradient descending function
- No ability to scale input
- Tons of bugs

This fantastic software is provided *AS IS* and without any warranty.

This is just for academic purpose while I'm studying nonlinear regression and model identification

# RSNN
Ridiculously Simple Neural Network for nonlinear regression

## Welcome
This is an incredible simple feedforward neural network that I've implemented.
It's written in python and it has this awsome features:
- Nonlinear regression with sigmoid functions
- A single neuron **NEW! MORE THAN ONE NEURON**
- No gradient descending function **NEW SORT OF GRADIENT DESCENDING - Need help!**
- No ability to scale input **YEAH I FORGOT ABOUT THAT**
- Tons of bugs **LESS TONS BUGS!**

This fantastic software is provided **AS IS** and without any warranty.

This is just for academic purpose while I'm studying nonlinear regression and model identification

### Usage
RSSN is written in Python 3.
I personally recommend to install Continuum Anaconda.
Once you've installed it just run
```
python3 rssn.py
```

If you don't want to install the complete Anaconda package first install dependecies:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
and then execute the script with:
```
python3 rssn.py
```

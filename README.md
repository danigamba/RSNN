# RSNN
Ridiculously Simple Neural Network

## Welcome
This is an incredible simple neural network that I've implemented.
It's written in python and it has this awsome features:
- A single neuron
- One input one output regression
- No gradient descending function
- No ability to scale input
- Tons of bugs

This fantastic software is provided *AS IS* and without any warranty.

This is just for academic purpose while I'm studying nonlinear regression and model identification

### Usage
RSSN is written in Python 3.
I personally recommend to install Continuum Anaconda.
Once you've installed it just run
'python3 rssn.py'

If you don't want to install the complete Anaconda package first install dependecies:
'pip3 install -r requirements.txt'
and then execute the script with:
'python3 rssn.py'
